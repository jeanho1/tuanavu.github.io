Hi! My name is Tuan Vu and I am currently a Data Scientist, a blogger and a youtuber.

I created __Apply Data Science__ as a channel where people from all backgrounds can come, learn and share ideas about Data Science, Machine Learning, and Computer Science related topics.

## Learning

All of the tutorials can be found on this [website](https://www.applydatascience.com/), and the [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiWjUAmiF3v91NbHOKuPNow) channel.
